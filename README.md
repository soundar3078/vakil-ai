* ray
* langchain
* streamlit
* faiss
* requests  # Added

###   Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/BharatLAW.git](https://github.com/your-repo/BharatLAW.git)
    cd BharatLAW
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up the Hugging Face API Token:**

    Obtain an API token from <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>.
    You'll need this to authenticate with the Hugging Face Inference API.

    **>   To set this API token as an environment variable, you can use the following approach:**

    * On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        echo "export HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN='Your-HuggingFace-API-Token-Here'" >> ~/.bash_profile
        source ~/.bash_profile
        ```

    * On Windows (using Command Prompt):

        ```cmd
        setx HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN "Your-HuggingFace-API-Token-Here"
        ```

    * On Windows (using PowerShell):

        ```powershell
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN", "Your-HuggingFace-API-Token-Here", "User")
        ```

    This token is crucial for the chatbot to access language model functionalities provided by Hugging Face.
